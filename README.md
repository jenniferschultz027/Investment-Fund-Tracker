# Investment-Fund-Tracker
This program is an investment management algorithm to optimize trend following methods for alternating between growth and value stocks. This program calculates which dates over the span of 15 years saw a switch in these funds, so that it can be determined when growth stocks were preferred, which meant that these could outperform the overall market due to their future potential, or when value stocks were preferred, which would provide a superior return since they trade below their worth. The purpose of this program is to have a better investment result than holding one fund the entire the time. By switching to the best performing fund, there will be a better return on the investment.
